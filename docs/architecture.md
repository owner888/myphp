# Architecture notes

Companion to AGENTS.md: the reasoning behind its rules, with the numbers.

## Why ext-ffi and not an extension

mygo calls Cocoa, GTK and Win32 through `purego` (dlopen + typed calls +
callbacks) so that it stays pure Go. `ext-ffi` is the same tool in PHP:
`dlopen`, typed calls through `FFI::cast` to function-pointer types, and PHP
closures as C callbacks (libffi closures). No C of our own to build or ship.

Measured (PHP 8.3, x86_64 container; Apple Silicon is faster):

| call | cost |
|---|---|
| C function, no args | 35 ns |
| C function, struct argument | ~125 ns |
| C → PHP closure, struct argument | ~115 ns |
| 10 000 rects (6 floats each) written into an FFI `float[]` | 0.6 ms |

The FFI boundary is never the frame budget's problem.

## Why immediate mode survives in PHP

mygo rebuilds the element tree, lays it out and paints every frame it needs
(`ui/runtime.go: runFrame`), with a cheaper `repaintFrame` when only
animated drawings moved. The worry for PHP was per-frame object churn.
Measured in `examples/native` on an M-series Mac, NSTimer at 60 Hz:

| nodes per frame | build | layout | paint (CoreGraphics) | total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 706 | 1.8 ms | 0.7 ms | 0.4 ms | ~3 ms |
| 9 006 | 2.8 ms | 1.1 ms | 0.2 ms | ~4.2 ms |

60.0 fps at both sizes; memory flat (4 MB and 6 MB). Nodes hold no parent
pointer, so a frame's tree has no cycles and reference counting frees it:
the cycle collector never ran. Headroom to the 16.6 ms budget is about
30 000 nodes per frame, before virtualized lists cut the count further.

## Rules that fell out of the PoC

- One `FFI` instance per OS bridge. Structs from one instance cannot be
  passed to functions of another ("incompatible argument"), so NSRect,
  CGRect and friends live where they are used.
- `objc_msgSend` is never declared variadic. On arm64, variadic arguments
  go to the stack; objc_msgSend wants them in registers. Cast its address
  to an exact function-pointer type per signature instead.
- A PHP closure passed as a C function pointer is backed by a libffi
  closure that dies with its CData. Keep every callback in a struct field
  held for the life of the process (`ObjC::$keep`).
- Callbacks run only on the main thread. PHP's engine is not re-entrant
  from another thread: CoreAudio render callbacks, CVDisplayLink and
  dispatch queues must not call into PHP. Use NSTimer / run-loop sources.
- Intel Macs return NSRect through `objc_msgSend_stret`; unsupported for
  now, the bridge refuses to boot there.

## Open items

- `-[NSView displayLinkWithTarget:selector:]` returned a link that never
  ticked after `addToRunLoop:forMode:`; NSTimer at 1/60 s is used meanwhile.
- Text sizes are estimated (`Context::text`); CoreText shaping with a glyph
  atlas replaces them.
- Painting goes through CoreGraphics, one FFI call per rect; the Metal
  renderer takes a display list in one buffer per frame.
